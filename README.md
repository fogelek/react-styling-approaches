# React Styling Approaches
This project is a simple showcase that is comparing three different approaches to styling in React, with a reference being bare CSS import.
- Styled Components - one of the most popular styling libraries for React (https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
- CSS Modules - scope-encapsulated CSS files (https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- Griffel - in-house CSS-IN-JS library from Microsoft (https://github.com/microsoft/griffel)

It uses **Fluent UI** as a component baseline and **yarn** as a package manager

It does not automatically update code in txt files, so if you want to play around and see code changes on the actual page, you need to manually copy code into correct text files
